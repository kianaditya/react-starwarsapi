# Star Wars API

This is a practice app in [React](https://reactjs.org/) ( a javascript frontend framework designed by Facebook), to fetch information from [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/), use information to fetch further data, and eventually compare it and show the result.

## Concept
* We choose two random characters from Star Wars
* We get information about their Home Worlds
* Depending on whether they both have same Home Worlds, we show the result
